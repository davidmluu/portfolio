## Portfolio Website

This personal portfolio is a place to
1. collect and show projects completed for the Web Dev Bootcamp at UpLeveled in Vienna
2. practice frontend coding skills
3. have fun working with cool tools such as
  * GitHub
  * Netlify
  * VSC
  * and others

The website project is borrowed by me, Sarah, from here: https://github.com/upleveled/next-portfolio-dev.
It is built with
* HTML
* CSS and
* JS 
and will run in your browser when you tell it to navigate to the correct URL.
